# Loxley's Modules
*Fixing the game one module at a time.*

## Preface
This is a collection of modules for the [AirSkyBoat](https://github.com/AirSkyBoat/AirSkyBoat)/[LandSandBoat](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/) FFXI server emulator. I don't currently run an emulation server, but over the years I've had many ideas for one, so I made this repository for my ideas.

These modules are free for anyone to use on their own server, and I encourage it. If your server runs any of these modules, feel free to drop me a message, I'm always happy to hear about it.

## List
* HELM Claim System

> Retrict the use of gathering points for 10 seconds to the first player who uses them.

* Oztroja Escape

> Allows players to escape the final floor of Castle Oztroja in classic FF fashion

* Pre-Zilart
> A module designed to recreate the 2002 era experience from before RotZ (the first expansion).

* Reasonable EXP

> Flatten the EXP curve that was artificially inflated to lengthen the game during era.
