# Loxley's Modules
*Fixing the game one module at a time.*

## Preface
This is a collection of modules for the [AirSkyBoat](https://github.com/AirSkyBoat/AirSkyBoat)/[LandSandBoat](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/) FFXI server emulator. I don't currently run an emulation server, but over the years I've had many ideas for one, so I made this repository for my ideas.

These modules are free for anyone to use on their own server, and I encourage it. If your server runs any of these modules, feel free to drop me a message, I'm always happy to hear about it.

## List
